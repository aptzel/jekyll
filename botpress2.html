 <H2>What is an AI chatbot?
 </H2>
 <p>
  A standard or traditional chatbot that you might find on a website or on a support portal uses predefined rules and patterns to respond to user inputs. It relies on hundreds of keywords and predefined responses to generate answers. These chatbots can be very time-consuming to build and maintain.

 

A chatbot powered by AI, uses advanced generative language models to analyze the context of the conversation and generate more intelligent and contextually relevant responses. AI-powered chatbots have the ability to understand and replicate human communication in a more sophisticated and dynamic manner compared to traditional chatbots. 

This also allows the chatbot to utilize large amounts of unstructured data such as product documentation, user manuals and websites related to a specific context to generate more accurate and up to date answers than public LLM's (Large Language Models).

This chatbot has been trained on the following data:

 

OneStream Foundation Handbook
OneStream XF Design and Reference Guide
OneStream Application Basics
OneStream Finance Rules and Calculations Handbook
 

The chatbot also has access to the OneStream website
